Ideas for sections

* Strongly typed incremental immutable statically-analyzable heterogeneous batch programs
* DAGs that separate resource acquisition from processing. \(General resource acquisition pattern\)
* Designing for containerized/heterogeneous pipelines
* CLI as a universal interface \(file/arg duality\)
* Quantized state pattern + Faking symlinks \(+ CI artifacts\)
* \_METADATA pattern
* Partition columns
* Data catalogs
* \_SUCCESS pattern
* Recomputation and backfills
* Depends\_on\_past and rollup computations
* Machine learning workflow
